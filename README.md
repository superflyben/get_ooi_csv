# get_ooi_csv
Matlab script to retrieve and concatenate data files from OOI.

The starting point for this script is the download link sent from noreply@oceanobservatories.org in response to a data request. The link should be pasted into the appropriate spot near the top of the script, and the 'choice' variable set to 1 for text or 2 for numeric output. The text option is faster but results in much more RAM usage.
